### The History of Micro-Lending
Low income people have always been exploited by loan sharks and predatory lending services.

**(1976)** - Mohammed Yanus, an economics professor, founds the Grammen Bank Project in Bangladesh to study the offering of microlending and bank services to poor business owners who were routinely targeted by predatory lenders. 

**(2005)** - the United Nations declares 2005 the International Year of Microcredit

**(2008)** - Mohammad Yanus, founder of the Grammen Bank Project wins the Nobel Peace Prize for his work.

*"Lasting peace can not be achieved unless large population groups find ways in which to break out of poverty."* - **Nobel Committee** (2008)

**(2011)** - Shivani Siroya founds Tala a microfinancing company

" *I realized all this daily life data is sitting right on our phones... We built that observation into an Android app. With usersâ€™ permission, the app looks at their phone usage patterns, their behavior within our app, and other data. We scan texts for receipts and transactions, for example, and try to understand communication patterns and habits. This information allows us to establish trust and provide unsecured credit to customers we have never met.* " - **Shivani Siroya**

**(2010-2020)** - Microlending companies begin to harness the power of AI and machine learning to determine lendees' creditworthiness.

### The Competition
**Jamii Bora** - Microfinance company based out of Nairobi, Kenya. Founded in 1999, its now the largest microfinance company in Nigeria.

**Konfio** - provides online lending to micro-businesses in latin america. 

**Kiva** - Provides microfinance services to more than 80 non-profit companies worldwide. Lended out over *$1.6B* in loans.

### Recommendations to Tala
1. Speed up how quickly money is sent to customers by using crypto. Someone can get signed up for the app & registered within 3 minutes according to Tala Founder Shivani Siroya. If we send them crypto they can literally spend this money within 5 minutes of downloading the app. 

2. Allow people to lend their money out on this app. Potential lenders could choose their target interest rate based on their risk tolerance level, similar to investing in an ETF. This way massive pools of decentralized liquidity could spur on the growth of the app. Lenders could also track the traits of who gets the money they lent out on a blockchain. Lenders could then try to arbitrage and get the best rate of return by creating lending strategies based on traits gathered by the app. This would lead to a "hive-mind" effect similar to the stock market resulting in extreme pricing efficiency.
